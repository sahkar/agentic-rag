One is p3.2xlarge, which is configured\nwith 8 vCPUs (Intel Xeon E5-2686 v4), 1 GPU (NVIDIA\nV100 with 16 GB GPU memory), PCIe 3.0 ×16, and 61 GB\nmemory. The other is g4dn.2xlarge, which is configured with\n8 vCPUs (Intel Platinum 8259CL), 1 GPU (NVIDIA T4 with\n16 GB GPU memory), PCIe 3.0 ×8, and 32 GB memory. The\nsoftware environment includes PyTorch-1.3.0, torchvision0.4.2, scipy-1.3.2, and CUDA-10.1. We use PyTorch with our\nplugins for all mechanisms in comparison for consistency,\nwhich provides better results for stop-and-start than native\nPyTorch from Python-PyPI used in Table 1.\nWorkloads. The models include ResNet152 [17], Inception_v3 [22] and Bert_base [23], which are standard benchmarks for evaluating DL systems. We use representative configurations for each model. The experiments cover both training and inference. We use single-GPU inference and training\ntasks as discussed in §4.5. Training tasks periodically checkpoint their models to the host memory, and restart from the\nlatest checkpoint after preemption. The checkpointing frequency of training tasks is set according to the scheduling\ncycle to minimize checkpointing overhead. The default batch\nsize for training is 32, and that for inference is 8.\nMetrics. We use throughput and latency as evaluation metrics.\nEach number is reported with the average of 100 runs. For\nFigure 6(b), we additionally report the minimum and maximum latencies using the error bar, because the latency of the\nfirst batch and those of later batches in one scheduling cycle\ncan differ significantly due to switching overhead.\n6.1\n\nEnd-to-End Experiments\n\nMinimizing end-to-end overhead. In this experiment, a\nclient sends an inference task to a GPU server, and the GPU\nserver preempts the training task to execute the inference\ntask and sends a reply back to the client. We measure the the\nend-to-end latency experienced by the client. We compare the\nfollowing mechanisms.\n• Ready model. There is no training task. The process with\nthe required model is already loaded in the GPU. This solution provides the lower bound, which is the lowest latency\nwe can achieve for an inference task.\n• Stop-and-start. It stops the training task in the GPU, and\nthen starts the inference task. This solution is used by existing systems like Gandiva [24] for task switching, which\nreported similar second-scale overhead.\n• NVIDIA MPS. This is the multi-process support from\nNVIDIA which allows the inference process to share the\nGPU with the training process. We initialize separate processes in advance. The training task occupies the entire\nGPU memory and does not stop when inference tasks come.\nCUDA unified memory is used for memory swapping.\n• PipeSwitch. This is the proposed system.
