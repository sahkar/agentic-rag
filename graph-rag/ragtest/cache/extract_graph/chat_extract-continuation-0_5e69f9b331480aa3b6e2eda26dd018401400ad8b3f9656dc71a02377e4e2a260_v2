It\nis easy to keep the same order for the memory daemon and\nthe worker because the neural network model is known and\ngiven, and the memory daemon only needs to use the same\norder to transmit the model as the worker would. As a result,\nthe memory daemon can minimize the usage of expensive\nGPU IPCs. It only uses the GPU IPC once to initialize the\nworker, and then uses cheap CPU IPCs to notify the worker\nwhich pipeline group has been transmitted.\nPin memory. The OS would swap a memory page to disk\nif the page is inactive for a certain amount of time. GPUs\nrequire a page in the host memory to be pinned (or pagelocked) in order to transmit the data in the page to the GPU\nmemory. Otherwise, a temporary pinned page is created for\nthe transmission. We pin the pages of the memory daemon to\nthe host memory, to eliminate this overhead.\n4.4\n\nActive-Standby Worker Switching\n\nPipeSwitch aims to provide fast task switching and ensure\nprocess-level isolation. Process-level isolation is desirable\nbecause it ensures that one task cannot read the memory of\nanother task, and that the crashing of one task, e.g., because\nof a bug, does not affect other tasks or the entire system.\nA naive solution is to use separate processes and start the\nnew task after the current task is stopped. As we have profiled\n\n14th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation\n\nUSENIX Association\n\n\fTwo Processes\nOne Process\nActive-Standby\n\nNo Task\nCleaning\nOverhead\n\nNo Task\nInitialization\nOverhead\n\n×\n×\n√\n\n×\n√\n√\n\nProcessLevel\nIsolation\n√\n×\n√\n\nTable 2: Comparison of worker switching mechanisms.\nin Table 1, such sequential execution incurs long delay due to\nold task cleaning and new task initialization.\nAnother possible solution is to let the current and new tasks\nshare the same process with a warm CUDA context, so that\nthe new task can reuse the GPU environment of the current\ntask. This avoids the new task initialization, but it still has the\noverhead for the current task to clean its status. In addition, it\ndoes not provide process-level isolation between tasks.\nWe design an active and standby worker switching mechanism that hides the overhead of both task cleaning and task\ninitialization, and also ensures process-level isolation. Similar\nto the naive solution, we use separate processes to achieve\nprocess-level isolation. PipeSwitch has an active worker and\nmultiple standby workers. Each worker is a separate process,\nand initializes its own GPU environment (i.e., CUDA context)\nwhen it is first created. This eliminates the GPU environment initialization overhead when a new task is assigned to a\nworker. When a current task is stopped, a major job is to clear\nasynchronous CUDA functions queued on the GPU. We insert synchronization points into training tasks, so the number\nof queued functions are limited and can be quickly cleared.\nSynchronization points are not needed for inference tasks as\nthey are short and not preempted. Another job is to free its\nGPU memory. An important property of the cleaning procedure is that it does not modify the content of the memory, but\nonly cleans the metadata, i.e., GPU memory pointers. As the\nGPU memory is managed by PipeSwitch, the cleaning procedure deletes the pointers pointing to the tensor data rather\nthan freeing the actual data. Therefore, it is safe for the new\ntask to transmit its model to the GPU memory at the same\ntime. In other words, we can parallelize the task cleaning of\nthe current task and the pipelined model transmission of the\nnew task, to hide the task cleaning overhead. This choice is\noptimized for performance, and is not a problem for a trusted\nenvironment. It is possible that a latter process can read the\nmemory data of a previous process. If this is a concern, an\nadditional zero-out operation can be added. GPU has high\nmemory bandwidth (e.g., 900GB/s for V100). It would incur\nsub-millisecond overhead for zeroing-out most models like\nResNet-152 (around 240MB). On the other hand, for a trusted\nenvironment, it is unnecessary to release all allocated memory\nfor the preempted process if the new process does not require\nentire GPU memory, and this could be achieved by some simple coordination. Table 2 summarizes the differences between\nthese three solutions.\n\nUSENIX Association\n\nIn summary, to switch workers, the controller signals the\ncurrent active worker to stop, deletes the GPU memory allocated to it, and allocates the GPU memory to the new active\nworker. The controller ensures only one active worker to guarantee exclusive occupation of the GPU.\nThere is a trade-off between the number of standby workers and their GPU memory consumption. On one hand, task\ncleaning takes time. If a new task arrives before a standby\nworker finishes cleaning a previous task, the new task needs\nto wait, which increases its startup time. On the other hand,\nit is possible to have many standby workers so that there\nis always at least one idle standby worker. However, every\nstandby worker needs to maintain its own CUDA context,\nwhich consumes a few hundred MB GPU memory. Our experience is that two standby workers are sufficient to ensure at\nleast one idle worker, which eliminates the waiting time and\nhas moderate GPU memory consumption.\n4.5\n\nDiscussion\n\nPipeSwitch is focused on single-GPU tasks for training and\ninference. For inference tasks, strict SLOs require requests to\nbe handled in small batches for low latency, so\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PIPE SWITCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PipeSwitch is a mechanism designed to provide fast task switching and ensure process-level isolation in GPU environments, optimizing performance for training and inference tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USENIX ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>USENIX Association is an organization that hosts conferences and symposiums focused on advanced computing systems and technologies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESNET-152<|>EVENT<|>ResNet-152 is a deep learning model architecture that is commonly used for image classification tasks, known for its high performance and efficiency.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIPE SWITCH<|>USENIX ASSOCIATION<|>PipeSwitch is discussed in the context of a paper presented at the USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIPE SWITCH<|>RESNET-152<|>PipeSwitch optimizes the performance of tasks that may involve models like ResNet-152 during training and inference<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
