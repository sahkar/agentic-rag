Its performance is similar to the ready\nmodel when the model is preloaded, and is similar to NVIDIA\nMPS when the model is in the host memory. Figure 5 shows\nthe latency experienced by the client, and Table 3 shows the\ntotal overhead. The total overhead is the difference between\nthe latency of a mechanism and that of the ready model. It is\nobvious that stop-and-start performs the worst, which takes\nseveral seconds. The main source of the overhead is CUDA\ncontext initialization and first-time library loading operations\nin PyTorch. NVIDIA MPS has lower overhead compared to\nstop-and-start, but still incurs several hundred milliseconds\noverhead, which prevents MPS from meeting strict SLOs.\nOne source of the overhead is the contentions both on the\ncomputation and memory of the GPU, as the training task\ndo not stop when an inference task comes. Another source is\nGPU memory swapping. PipeSwitch performs the best and\nis close to the lower bound. The overhead of PipeSwitch for\nmost configurations is up to 10ms, except for BERT on T4,\nwhich is due to the large model size and the smaller PCIe\nbandwidth on T4 than that on V100. Since it also takes longer\n(120ms) to compute BERT on T4 even with the ready model,\nthe relative overhead is acceptable.\nWe also show the task startup overhead for PipeSwitch\nin Table 4, which is the difference between the time for\n\nUSENIX Association\n\n# of Layers\nAlgorithm 1\nOnly Pruning 1\nOnly Pruning 2\nNo Pruning\n\nResNet152\n\nInception_v3\n\nBert_base\n\n464\n1.33 s\n2.09 s\n3.44 h\n> 24 h\n\n189\n0.18 s\n0.30 s\n5.07 s\n> 24 h\n\n139\n0.34 s\n0.88 s\n> 24 h\n> 24 h\n\nTable 5: Effectiveness of two pruning techniques.\nPipeSwitch to start computing the first layer and that for\nthe ready model to start computing. The startup overhead\nof PipeSwitch is only a few milliseconds.\nEnabling fine-grained scheduling cycles. In this experiment, we compare throughput and end-to-end latency of different mechanisms under different scheduling cycles. We use\nResNet152 for both training and inference on eight p3.2xlarge\ninstances, and switch between these two tasks after each\nscheduling cycle. Figure 6(a) shows the inference throughput.\nThe dashed line is the upper bound, which is the throughput of\nthe ready model assuming no task switching. The throughput\nof stop-and-start is nearly zero for scheduling cycles smaller\nthan 10 s, because it takes several seconds for task switching.\nMPS keeps poor throughput around 100 batches per second.\nWe define GPU utilization as the ratio to the upper bound.\nPipeSwitch has high throughput close to the upper bound,\nachieving near 100% GPU utilization.\nFigure 6(b) shows the average latency of the inference tasks.\nThe dashed line is the lower bound, which is the average\nlatency of the ready model assuming no task switching. The\nerror bar indicates the minimum and maximum latency. Stopand-start has poor latency because the first batch has several\nseconds overhead. MPS has about 80 ms average latency, and\nhas several hundred milliseconds latency for the first batch.\n\n14th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation\n\n509\n\n\fPipeSwitch\nMPS\n\n300\n\n100\n\nStop-and-start\nUpper bound\n\n200\n100\n0\n\n1s\n\n2s\n\n5s\n\n10s\n\nLatency (ms)\n\nThroughput (batches/sec)\n\n400\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n30s\n\nPipeSwitch\nMPS\n\n250\n\nStop-and-start\n\nLower bound\n\n400\n\n150\n100\n\n200\n0\n\n1s\n\n2s\n\n5s\n\n10s\n\nInception_v3\n\nBert_base\n\nPipeSwitch\nPer-layer pipeline\nGrouped transmission\nNo optimization\n\n200\n\nLatency (ms)\n\nLatency (ms)\n\n7500\n\nResNet152\n\n(a) p3.2xlarge (NVIDIA V100, PCIe 3.0 ร16).\n\n(a) Throughput (eight p3.2xlarge instances).\n10000\n\nPipeSwitch\nPer-layer pipeline\nGrouped transmission\nNo optimization\n\n50\n0\n\n30s\n\nResNet152\n\nInception_v3\n\nBert_base\n\n(b) Latency.\n\n(b) g4dn.2xlarge (NVIDIA T4, PCIe 3.0 ร8).\n\nFigure 6: Throughput and latency under different scheduling\ncycles for ResNet on p3.2xlarge.\n\nFigure 7: Effectiveness of pipelined model transmission.\n\nPipeSwitch incurs only a few milliseconds overhead for task\nswitching, and achieves low latency close to the lower bound.\n6.2\n\nPipelined Model Transmission\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of pipelined model transmission,\nwe keep all other components of PipeSwitch the same, and\ncompare the following mechanisms discussed in ยง4.2.\nโข No optimization.
