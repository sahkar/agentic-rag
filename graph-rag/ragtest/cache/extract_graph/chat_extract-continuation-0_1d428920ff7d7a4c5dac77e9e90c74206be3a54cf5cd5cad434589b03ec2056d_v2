This solution incurs\nhigh overhead for DL applications because of two reasons.\nFirst, DL applications have large models and generate large\namounts of intermediate results, which require a lot of GPU\nmemory. Second, the native cudaMalloc function and CUDA\nunified memory are designed for general-purpose applications,\nand may incur unnecessary overhead for DL applications.\nWe exploit two characteristics of DL applications to minimize GPU memory management overhead. A DL task stores\ntwo important types of data in the GPU memory: the DNN\nmodel (including the model parameters), and the intermediate\nresults. First, the amount of memory allocated to the DNN\nmodel is fixed, and does not change during task execution. An\n\n14th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation\n\n505\n\n\finference task only uses the model for inference, and does\nnot change the model itself. While a training task updates the\nmodel, it only updates the model parameters (i.e., the weights\nof the neural network), not the DNN structure, and the amount\nof memory needed to store them stays the same.\nSecond, the intermediate results change in a simple, regular\npattern, which do not cause memory fragmentation. For an\ninference task, the intermediate results are the outputs of each\nlayer, which are used by the next layer. After the next layer is\ncomputed, they are no longer needed and can be safely freed.\nA training task differs in that the intermediate results generated in the forward pass cannot be immediately freed, because\nthey are also used by the backward pass to update the weights.\nHowever, the backward pass consumes the intermediate results in the reverse order as that the forward pass generates\nthem, i.e., the intermediate results are first-in-last-out. The\nmemory allocation and release can be handled by a simple\nstack-like mechanism, without causing memory fragmentation. The general-purpose GPU memory management does\nnot consider these characteristics, and is too heavy-weight for\nDL applications that require fast task switching.\nMinimize memory allocation overhead. Based on these\ntwo characteristics, we design a memory management mechanism tailored for DL applications. PipeSwitch uses a dedicated memory daemon to manage the GPU memory. To\nbe compatible with the existing system and incur minimal\nchanges, instead of replacing the GPU memory manager, the\nmemory daemon uses cudaMalloc to obtain the GPU memory when the system starts, and then dynamically allocates\nthe memory to the workers at runtime. This eliminates the\noverhead for each worker to use cudaMalloc to get a large\namount of memory to store their models and intermediate\nresults. The memory daemon only needs to pass memory\npointers to the workers, which is light-weight. The daemon\nensures that each time only one worker owns the GPU memory to guarantee memory isolation between workers. Each\nworker uses a memory pool to allocate the memory to store\nits model and intermediate results, and recycles the memory\nto the pool after the intermediate results are no longer needed.\nThe memory management of PipeSwitch extends that of PyTorch. It is designed and optimized for efficient GPU memory\nallocation between different tasks, while the memory management in PyTorch handles memory allocation for a task\nitself. PipeSwitch inserts GPU memory blocks to PyTorch\nGPU memory pool, and PyTorch creates tensors on them.\nMinimize memory footprint and avoid extra memory\ncopies. The server stores the DNN models in the host memory.\nReplicating the models in each worker incurs high memory\nfootprint, and reduces the number of models a server can store,\nand consequently the types of tasks the server can execute. On\nthe other hand, storing the models in a dedicate process has\nminimal memory footprint as each model is only stored once,\nbut it incurs an extra memory copy from this process to a\n\n506\n\nworker to start a task, which hurts the task switching time. We\nuse unified memory management with the memory daemon to\nboth achieve minimal memory footprint and eliminate extra\nmemory copies. PipeSwitch stores the models in the memory\ndaemon so that the server only needs to keep one copy of each\nmodel in the host memory. Because the memory daemon also\nmanages the GPU memory, it directly transmits the model\nfrom the host memory to the GPU memory for task startup,\nwhich eliminates the extra memory copy from the memory\ndaemon to the worker.\nMinimize IPC overhead. After the model is transmitted to\nthe GPU, the memory daemon needs to notify the worker\nand export the relevant GPU memory handlers to the worker,\nso that the worker can access the model to execute its task.\nThis can be implemented by IPC APIs provided by GPUs,\ne.g., cudaIpcOpenMemHandle for NVIDIA GPUs. We have\nmeasured the performance of these IPC APIs and found that\nthey incur high overhead (§6). The overhead is exacerbated\nby the pipeline because the pipeline needs to invoke the IPCs\nfrequently to synchronize model transmission and task execution for every pipeline group, instead of invoking the IPC\nonly once for the entire model transmission.\nWe leverage a property of DL applications to minimize the\nIPC overhead. The property is that the memory allocation\nprocess for a neural network model is deterministic. Specifically, given the same GPU memory region and the same\nmodel, as long as the memory daemon and the worker uses\nthe same order to allocate memory for the model parameters,\nthe memory pointers for the parameters would be the same. It\nis easy to keep the same order for the memory daemon and\nthe worker because the neural network model is known and\ngiven, and the memory daemon only needs to use the same\norder to transmit the model as the worker would. As a result,\nthe memory daemon can minimize the usage of expensive\nGPU IPCs. It only uses the GPU IPC once to initialize the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PIPE SWITCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PipeSwitch is a memory management mechanism designed for deep learning applications to optimize GPU memory allocation and minimize overhead during task execution.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTORCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, which handles memory allocation for tasks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by NVIDIA, allowing developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit for general purpose processing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to accelerate the processing of images and computations, particularly in deep learning applications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNN MODEL<|>EVENT<|>A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is a computational model used in deep learning that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, which are used for tasks such as inference and training.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERMEDIATE RESULTS<|>EVENT<|>Intermediate results are the outputs generated by each layer of a neural network during the forward pass, which are used in subsequent computations.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIPE SWITCH<|>PYTORCH<|>PipeSwitch is designed to extend and optimize the memory management capabilities of PyTorch for deep learning applications<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIPE SWITCH<|>CUDA<|>PipeSwitch utilizes CUDA for memory management and allocation in GPU environments<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIPE SWITCH<|>GPU<|>PipeSwitch is tailored to manage GPU memory effectively, minimizing overhead for deep learning tasks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNN MODEL<|>INTERMEDIATE RESULTS<|>The DNN model generates intermediate results during the forward pass, which are essential for the backward pass in training<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
