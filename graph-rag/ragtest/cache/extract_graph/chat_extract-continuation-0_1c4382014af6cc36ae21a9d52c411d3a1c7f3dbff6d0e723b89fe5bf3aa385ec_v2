The DNN models can be held in\nhost memory, which is much larger and cheaper than GPU\nmemory, and the GPU can quickly context-switch between\n\n14th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation\n\n499\n\n\fthe models either for training or inference. This way, the number of applications that can be multiplexed is not limited by\nthe GPU memory size, and each application is able to use the\nentire GPU compute and memory resources during its time\nslice. To our best knowledge, no existing solution offers such\ncontext switching abstraction for GPU.\nTo this end, we propose PipeSwitch, a system that (i) enables GPU-efficient multiplexing of many DL applications on\nGPU servers via fine-grained time-sharing, and (ii) achieves\nmillisecond-scale latencies and high throughput as dedicated\nservers. PipeSwitch enables unused cycles of an inference\napplication to be filled by training or other inference applications. We achieve so by introducing a new technology called\npipelined context switching that exploits the characteristics\nof DL applications to achieve millisecond-scale overhead for\nswitching tasks on GPUs. Such small switching overhead is\ncritical for DL applications to satisfy strict SLO requirements.\nTo understand the problem, we first perform a measurement study to profile the task switching overhead and analyze\nthe overhead of each component. We divide the switching\noverhead into four components, which are old task cleaning,\nnew task initialization, GPU memory allocation, and model\ntransmission via PCIe from CPU to GPU. Every component\ntakes a considerable amount of time, varying from tens of milliseconds to seconds. Such overhead is significant, because\nan inference task itself only takes tens of milliseconds on a\nGPU and the latency SLOs are typically a small multiple of\nthe inference time [3].\nWe take a holistic approach, and exploit the characteristics\nof DL applications to minimize the overhead of all the components. Our design is based on a key observation that DNN\nmodels have a layered structure and a layer-by-layer computation pattern. As such, there is no need to wait for the entire\nmodel to be transmitted to the GPU before starting computation. Based on this observation, we design a pipelined model\ntransmission mechanism, which pipelines model transmission\nover the PCIe and model computation in the GPU. Naive\npipelining on per-layer granularity introduces high overhead\non tensor transmission and synchronization. We divide layers\ninto groups, and design an optimal model-aware grouping\nalgorithm to find the best grouping strategy for a given model.\nThe computation of a DL task is layer by layer, which has\na simple, regular pattern for memory allocation. The default\ngeneral-purpose GPU memory management (e.g., CUDA unified memory [4]) is an overkill and incurs unnecessary overhead. We design unified memory management with a dedicated memory daemon to minimize the overhead. The daemon\npre-allocates the GPU memory, and re-allocates it to each task,\nwithout involving the expensive GPU memory manager. The\nDNN models are stored only once in the memory daemon,\ninstead of in every worker, to minimize memory footprint.\nWe exploit that the memory allocation for a DNN model is\ndeterministic to eliminate extra memory copies between the\ndaemon and the workers and reduce the IPC overhead .\n\n500\n\nWe use an active-standby mechanism for fast worker\nswitching and process-level isolation. Each server contains\nan active worker and multiple standby workers. The active\nworker executes the current task on the GPU; the standby\nworkers stay on the CPU and wait for the next task. Our\nmechanism parallelizes old task cleaning in the active worker\nand new task initialization in the standby worker to minimize\nworker switching overhead. With separate worker processes,\nPipeSwitch enforces process-level isolation.\nPipelining is a canonical technique widely used in computer systems to improve system performance and maximize resource utilization. Prior work in DL systems such as\nPipeDream [8] and ByteScheduler [9] has applied pipelining\nto distributed training. These solutions focus on inter-batch\npipelining to overlap computation and gradient transmission\nof different batches for training workloads of the same DNN\nmodel. The key novelty of PipeSwitch is that it introduces\nintra-batch pipelining to overlap model transmission and computation to reduce the overhead of switching between different\nDNN models, which can be either inference or training. Unlike pipelining for the same task, PipeSwitch requires us to\naddress new technical challenges on memory management\nand worker switching across different processes. We design\nnew techniques to not only support training, but also inference\nthat has strict SLOs.\nIn summary, we make the following contributions.\n• We propose PipeSwitch, a system that enables GPUefficient fine-grained time-sharing for multiple DL applications, and achieves millisecond-scale context switching\nlatencies and high throughput.\n• We introduce pipelined context switching, which exploits\nthe characteristics of DL applications, and leverages\npipelined model transmission, unified memory management, and active-standby worker switching to minimize\nswitching overhead and enforce process-level isolation.\n• We implement a system prototype and integrate it with PyTorch. Experiments on a variety of DL models and GPU\ncards show that PipeSwitch only incurs a task startup overhead of 3.6–6.6 ms and a total overhead of 5.4–34.6 ms\n(10–50× better than NVIDIA MPS), and achieves near\n100% GPU utilization.\n\n2\n\nMotivation\n\nIn this section, we identify the inefficiencies in today’s shared\nGPU clusters, and motivate running\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PIPE SWITCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PipeSwitch is a system designed to enable GPU-efficient fine-grained time-sharing for multiple deep learning applications, achieving millisecond-scale context switching latencies and high throughput.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USENIX SYMPOSIUM<|>EVENT<|>The 14th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation is a conference where advancements in operating systems are discussed, including topics like GPU memory isolation and context switching.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTORCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, which has been integrated with PipeSwitch for experiments.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIPE SWITCH<|>USENIX SYMPOSIUM<|>PipeSwitch was presented or discussed at the USENIX Symposium, highlighting its innovations in GPU time-sharing<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIPE SWITCH<|>PYTORCH<|>PipeSwitch has been integrated with PyTorch for experiments, demonstrating its functionality in deep learning applications<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
