Experiments on a variety of DL models and GPU\ncards show that PipeSwitch only incurs a task startup overhead of 3.6–6.6 ms and a total overhead of 5.4–34.6 ms\n(10–50× better than NVIDIA MPS), and achieves near\n100% GPU utilization.\n\n2\n\nMotivation\n\nIn this section, we identify the inefficiencies in today’s shared\nGPU clusters, and motivate running DL workloads on GPUs\nin the fine-grained time-sharing model.\n2.1\n\nGPU Clusters\n\nShared GPU clusters. To run DNN workloads in a large\nscale, enterprises build GPU clusters that are either privately [10, 11] or publicly [12–14] shared by multiple users.\nSuch GPU clusters are usually specifically designed with dedicated physical forms and power supplies, along with high\nspeed networks and specialized task schedulers.\n\n14th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation\n\nUSENIX Association\n\n\fWhy build a shared cluster instead of a dedicated one for\neach user? The main reason is to bring down the cost. The\ndemand of training is not well predictable—it would depend\non the progress of different developers. The demand of inference is more predictable, e.g., an inference task for a particular application usually has a daily periodical pattern based\non the application usage. Nevertheless, the patterns can still\nvary across different tasks. Like traditional CPU workloads, a\nshared cluster by different tasks would increase the resource\nutilization via time-sharing.\nNo sharing between training and inference. However, such\n“shared” clusters are not shared between training and inference. Even though training and inference both use GPUs, the\ncurrent practice is to build dedicated clusters for training and\ninference separately. This brings several inefficiencies.\n• Inference clusters are over-provisioned for the peak load,\nbecause they directly serve user requests and need to meet\nstrict SLOs. Although inference clusters are not always running at high utilization, they cannot be utilized by training.\n• Training clusters are equipped with powerful GPUs to run\ntraining tasks, which are often elastic and do not have strict\ndeadlines. However, when there is a flash crowd (e.g., an application suddenly becomes popular and the demand grows\nbeyond the operator’s expectation), the training cluster cannot preempt the training tasks for inference tasks.\n• Even for inference tasks, production systems often allocate\nGPUs to applications on per-GPU granularity (e.g., binding\nGPUs to the VMs, containers or processes of an application), in order to limit the interference between different\napplications and satisfy the SLO requirements.\nOne of the reasons for separately provisioning is that GPUs\ndesigned for inference tasks might be too wimpy for training\ntasks. This, however, has started to change with the arrival of\nnew GPU hardware, most notably NVIDIA T4. Compared\nwith NVIDIA V100 which has up to 32GB GPU memory and\n15.7 TFLOPS (single-precision), NVIDIA T4 has comparable performance with 16GB GPU memory and 8.1 TFLOPS\n(single-precision). Also, new algorithms and systems for distributed training [8, 9, 15, 16] enable multiple GPUs to accelerate training, if one GPU is not fast enough.\nOur industry collaborator, a leading online service provider,\nconfirms this observation. This service provider currently runs\nmore than 10K V100 GPUs for training, and at least 5× as\nmany T4 GPUs for inference. The computation power on both\nsides is within the same order of magnitude. The inference\nworkload fluctuates in correlation with the number of active\nusers, and shows clear peaks and valleys within each day—\nthe peak demand during daytime is > 2× of the valley at\nmidnight. It would be a great match to utilize inference GPUs\nduring less busy times for training models that require daily\nupdates with latest data. A good example is to fine-tune BERT\nusing daily news. This means great opportunity in improving\nGPU utilization by Borg-like [1] systems for GPUs.\n\nUSENIX Association\n\n2.2\n\nFine-Grained Time-Sharing GPU\n\nWe envision to build GPU clusters that can be shared across\ndifferent applications including training and inference. We\npropose to pack multiple DL applications onto the same GPU\nvia fine-grained time-sharing abstraction to maximize GPU\nutilization. This is inspired by the OS scheduler and context\nswitching in the CPU world. It has the following advantages.\n• It would dramatically improve the resource utilization, especially because inference and training workloads have\ncomplementary usage patterns. Online inference services\nare often more idle during midnight, while many training\ndevelopers would start a time-consuming job at night. Besides, inference loads on different models have different\npatterns, which also benefits from the time sharing.\n• Similar to CPU workloads, fine-grained time-sharing can\nprovide better utilization than provisioning dedicated resources, while providing necessary process-level isolation.\n• It would greatly simplify the design of load balancers and\nschedulers as any server would be able to run any task with\nlow overhead to switch between different applications.\nThe gap: the precious GPU memory and slow switching.\nTo achieve this goal, however, we face a major challenge—fast\nGPU context switching between different processes. A modern server can be equipped with several TB of host memory,\nenabling it to load many applications. However, task execution on GPUs require GPU memory, which is very limited\neven on high-end GPUs, e.g., 16 GB for T4 and 32 GB for\nV100. More importantly, GPU memory is purposed for task\nexecution, not for storing the state of idle applications.
