While NVIDIA MPS is a framework that allows multiple processes to share a single GPU, it can experience significant overhead during task switching, which can impact overall performance. PipeSwitch aims to minimize this overhead, thereby improving the efficiency of GPU task management.\n\nIn comparative analyses, PipeSwitch is evaluated against NVIDIA MPS, focusing on metrics such as overhead and performance during GPU task switching. The enhancements offered by PipeSwitch are particularly relevant for applications that require rapid context switching between multiple GPU tasks, as they can lead to more streamlined operations and better resource utilization.\n\nOverall, PipeSwitch represents a significant advancement over NVIDIA MPS, providing a more efficient mechanism for managing GPU resources and reducing the performance penalties associated with task switching.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1747244565, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_129a36352a", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 357, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
